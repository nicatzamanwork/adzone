    "description": "Azerbaijan is a true land of contrasts, where different eras and styles blend in an astonishing way. Majestic natural landscapes, ancient Muslim and pagan architecture, elegant 19th-century buildings, Soviet-era heritage, and futuristic structures that seem to have come straight from the screens of science fiction films all coexist here. This country is the perfect film location for any project: history movies to adventure, action sci-fi and romantic genres.",
